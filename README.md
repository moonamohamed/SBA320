A fun React app that displays random jokes when you click the 'Tell Me a Joke' button.
It has a cool and simple design that catches your eye.
The app uses React and Redux to manage the jokes and images. It's simple to use and great if you want to have a laugh or make someone else laugh.
It loads a random joke from an API, when you click the button.
I used React, Redux Toolkit, JavaScript, HTML & CSS, Vite, and Netlify to complete the app setup.
